                    In the next few weeks, we'll journey with Fred Smith, hearing stories from
                    his journey and those around him. Fred's heart is for every son and daughter 
                    of God to realize that God's personal love for us is ... everything.
                    <span class="hidden">The journey starts on March 4. Thanks for joining us.</span>
